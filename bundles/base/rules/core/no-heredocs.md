## Rule
Do not write or change file contents from a shell command: no heredocs (`cat > f <<'EOF'`, `python - <<'EOF'`), no `sed -i`, `perl -i` or `tee`, no `>` or `>>` into a file, no `printf >> f`, and no writing to `/tmp` or `/private/tmp`. Do not use heredoc-style blocks as comments or docstrings either.

## Why
Heredocs and shell redirects break on some shells, are easy to get wrong with quoting, cost many tokens to emit and review, and skip the file tools that show a reviewable change. Agents kept doing it in earlier runs after a heredoc-only rule was in their instructions, so a pre-tool hook now refuses these commands where the client supports one.

## Instead
Create or edit the file with `Write` or `Edit`. To rename, use `Edit` with `replace_all: true`. For a throwaway snippet, write it with `Write` to `.manifold/scratch/` (or the scratchpad the session names, never `/tmp`) and run the file. Use plain `#` or `//` comments, and docstrings only where the language expects them. If a command is blocked, do not work around it: ask a human for an exception and say what you already tried.

## Enforce
- hook: .manifold/hooks/guard.py
- review: compare "Rule exceptions" with .manifold/guard-log.jsonl
